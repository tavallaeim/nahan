# Project Nahan 2

### The Ultimate Serverless Gateway on Cloudflare Workers

**Nahan** (Persian for *Hidden/Concealed*) is a secure, lightweight, and highly customizable reverse proxy that runs entirely on the edge. It transforms your Cloudflare Worker into a powerful, obfuscated gateway using **VLESS** or **Trojan** protocols, managed via a beautiful, self-contained Web UI.

## 🌟 Why Nahan?

Nahan isn't just a proxy script — it's a complete management solution designed for **stealth**, **speed**, and **ease of use**.

- 🛡️ **Hidden in Plain Sight:** Unauthorized access attempts are proxied to legitimate sites (e.g., `ubuntu.com` or `docker.com`), making your gateway look like a regular website to network scanners.
- ⚡ **Zero Server Cost:** Runs entirely on Cloudflare's free plan. No VPS, no server maintenance.
- 🎨 **Modern Dashboard:** A fully embedded, mobile-friendly dashboard with Dark/Light modes and dual-language support (English / فارسی).
- 🤖 **Telegram Bot Integration:** Manage your gateway, check usage, and receive login alerts directly via Telegram.
- 📡 **Multi-User & Multi-IP:** Generate dedicated subscription links for different users and automatically combine them with clean IP lists.
- 💾 **D1 SQLite Storage:** Configuration persists in Cloudflare D1 database, eliminating KV write limitations.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- A **Cloudflare account** (free tier is sufficient) — [sign up here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- Access to **Workers & Pages** and **D1 SQLite Database** in your Cloudflare Dashboard
- A modern web browser
- *(Optional)* A Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID for bot integration

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to get your Nahan gateway running in under 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Create a D1 Database

Nahan stores all configuration in a Cloudflare D1 SQLite database. You must create this first.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. In the left sidebar, go to **Storage and databases** → **D1 SQLite Database**.
3. Click **Create database**.
4. Enter a name for your database — the suggested name is `iot_db` (the exact name doesn't matter).
5. Click **Create** to confirm.

> ✅ Your D1 database is now ready. Keep this page open — you'll need it in Step 3.

---

### Step 2: Deploy the Worker

1. In the Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to **Workers & Pages** → **Overview**.
2. Click **Create application** → **Create Worker**.
3. Enter a name for your worker (e.g., `nahan-core`).
4. Click **Deploy** to create the worker with placeholder code.
5. On the confirmation screen, click **Edit code** to open the online editor.
6. Select all existing placeholder code and **delete it**.
7. Open the Nahan repository and go to [`_worker.js`](https://github.com/itsyebekhe/nahan/blob/main/_worker.js).
8. Click **Raw**, then select all and copy the full contents.
9. Paste the copied code into the Cloudflare editor.
10. Click **Save and Deploy**.

> ✅ Your worker is deployed. It will not function fully until the D1 database is bound in the next step.

---

### Step 3: Bind the D1 Database

This step connects your D1 database to the worker so Nahan can read and write its configuration.

1. From the Workers & Pages overview, click on your worker (e.g., `nahan-core`).
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Bindings** section and click **Add binding**.
4. Select **D1 database** as the binding type.
5. Fill in the two fields:
   - **Variable name:** `IOT_DB` ← this must be exact, regardless of your database's actual name
   - **D1 Database:** Select the database you created in Step 1
6. Click **Save**.
7. Return to the worker overview and click **Deploy** (or **Redeploy**) to apply the binding.

> ✅ Nahan can now read and write persistent configuration data.

---

### Step 4: Access the Dashboard

1. From your worker's overview page, copy the worker URL — it looks like:
   ```
   https://nahan-core.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
   ```
2. In a browser, navigate to:
   ```
   https://<your-worker-domain>/sync/dash
   ```

   > **Note:** Visiting the root URL (`/`) or `/sync` without `/dash` intentionally shows a camouflage page (e.g., Ubuntu or Docker) to fool network scanners. This is expected behavior.

3. You should see the Nahan login screen.

---

### Step 5: First-Time Configuration

1. Enter the default master key and click **Authenticate**:
   ```
   admin
   ```

   > ⚠️ **If you see `⚠️ IOT_DB namespace missing!`** — your D1 database binding is not set up correctly. Return to Step 3.

2. You are now inside the Nahan dashboard.

3. **Immediately** go to the **System** tab and:
   - Change the **Master Key** from `admin` to a strong, private passphrase.
   - Change the **API Route** from `sync` to a secret keyword (e.g., `my-secret-path`). Your dashboard will move to `/<new-route>/dash`.
   - Set your **Device UUID** or leave it blank to auto-generate one.

4. Click **Update Config** to save.

> ✅ Your gateway is now live and secured.

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Guide

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: I see `⚠️ IOT_DB namespace missing!` after logging in.**
> The D1 database is not bound to your worker. Go back to Step 3, add the `IOT_DB` D1 binding, and redeploy.

**Q: My worker's root URL shows a random website instead of the dashboard.**
> This is intentional — Nahan camouflages itself. Always use `https://<your-worker-domain>/sync/dash`.

**Q: I changed the API Route and can't find the dashboard anymore.**
> Your dashboard moved to `https://<your-worker-domain>/<new-route>/dash`. If you've forgotten the route, check the D1 database via the Cloudflare Dashboard → **D1** → your database → browse the `kv_store` table.

**Q: I forgot my Master Key.**
> In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to **D1** → your database → **Console**, and run:
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM kv_store WHERE key = 'masterKey';
> ```
> You can also `UPDATE` or `DELETE` the row to reset it.

**Q: How do I update to a newer version of Nahan?**
> Repeat Step 2: open the Worker code editor, replace the code with the latest `_worker.js`, and save. Your D1 configuration is preserved.

**Q: How many requests can I handle on the free tier?**
> Cloudflare Workers free tier allows **100,000 requests/day**. Monitor usage via the Cloudflare Analytics integration in the Advanced tab.
